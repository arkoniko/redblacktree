# redblacktree
Implementation of a data structure called a tree red-black with the use of a template mechanism. 
The red-black tree interface (simplified) provides a pair of functions/methods, e.g., the left rotation of the indicated child-parent pair. 
The experiment included in the main() function is to: 
repeatedly add more and more numbers of elements (data) to the red-black tree (orders of magnitude from 101 all the way up to 107), and then
searching through it for some random data along with reporting the time.
